First there needs to be a scanner that is reading the input of the user for the groups leaving and entering.
There is also a count of people that needs to be updated and instantiated to the number of people in the room.
There will be a while loop on the outside that will read if there has been two consecutive inputs that exceed
the number of people allowed in the room at any given time, in the case that there is those two inputs then the 
while loop will be exited and the program will end. Inside the while loop will be conditionals in if statements
that will use the people count that is inputed by the user to determine whether the group can enter of if they can't
and perform the appropriate action in response. After those conditionals there will be print statements 
that show the current number of people in the room.
