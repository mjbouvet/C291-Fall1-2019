# C291-Final-Project
For your C291 final project you will be implementing Game Of Life.

#### There are only a couple rules that are needed to implement Game Of Life:

   * Any **live** cell with fewer than two live neighbors **dies**, as if caused by underpopulation.
   * Any **live** cell with more than three live neighbors **dies**, as if by overcrowding.
   * Any **live** cell with two or three live neighbors **lives** on to the next generation.
   * Any **dead** cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a **live** cell.

University of stanford has a very good explanation on how Game Of Life works. Please read through [this](http://web.stanford.edu/~cdebs/GameOfLife/) page before starting on this project.

Refer to Milestone_1 - Milestone_3 for more guidelines.
